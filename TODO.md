* Netlist generator NMOS case Idarin vs Vgate 
  - extract the correspond bin (bin table)
  - keep original, create a copy to be modified
  - generate netlist pointing to extracted bin (the one that we will modify)

  - find bin model to be modified (is big bang done for this bin?)
  - modify desired paramters
  - save
  - sim
  - plot
